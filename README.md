This page summarizes all the projects I worked on, if you want to explore a project more just click the title !

# [Project 1: Flight Delays Prediction Estimator](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Flight-Prediction) 
* Created a Machine learning model that estimates flight delays 
* Wrote SQL queries in VSCode to export a sample of the data stored in a Postgress database
* Engineered features like weahter conditions (using weather API),route traffic, and aggregate datetime dates. 
* Optimized our linear regression model performance by using ensemble stacking technique to get best model. 
* In process of building a user facing API using streamlit

# [Project 2: Churn Prediction classifier ](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Churn-Prediction) 
* Created a Machine learning model that solves a churn classification problem (IBM Data Set).
* Performed a lot of data exploratory analysis to better understand the customer segments with respect to the target variable churn. 
* Engineered features (dummy variables, aggregate monthly and total charges per servies).
* Balanced the data using oversampling & undersampling techniques (SMOTE).
* Improved the base model performance from 67% recall for minority group and 81% accuracy to 97% for both accuracy and recall. 
* Built a user facing API using streamlit, where user can upload a csv file of the data set and get the same dataset with a churn_probability column.
