# Marwan_Portfolio
This page summarizes all the projects I worked on, if you want to explore a project more just click the title !


# [Project 1: Churn Prediction classifier ](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Churn-Prediction) 
* Created a Machine learning model that solves a churn classification problem (IBM Data Set).
* Performed a lot of data exploratory analysis to better understand the customer segments with respect to the target variable churn. 
* Engineered features (dummy variables, aggregate monthly and total charges per servies).
* Balanced the data using oversampling & undersampling techniques (SMOTE).
* Improved the base model performance from 67% recall for minority group and 81% accuracy to 97% for both accuracy and recall. 
* Built a user facing API using streamlit, where user/company employee can upload a csv file of the data set and get the same dataset with a churn_probability column.

# [Project 2: Flight Delays Prediction Estimator](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Flight-Prediction) 
* Created a Machine learning model that estimates flight delays 
* Wrote SQL queries in VSCode to export a sample of the data stored in a Postgress database
* Engineered features like weahter conditions (using weather API),route traffic, and aggregate datetime dates. 
* Optimized our linear regression model performance by using ensemble stacking technique to get best model. 
* In process of building a user facing API using streamlit

# [Project 3:Loan Automation Approval Process (Mini Project, 1 day)](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Loan-Automation-Approval-Process-Classification-)

* Created a Machine learning model that predicts the probability a cutomer will get approved for a loan or not based on a data set with 11 features. 
* Cleaned the data properly (missing values, extreme values) 
* Performed a lot of data exploratory analysis to better understand the customer segments with respect to the target variable. 
* Optimized the base model accuracy from 69% in terms of accuracy and 78% for F1 score to 81.3% in terms of accuracy and 88% F1 score using piplines grid search to hyperparamter tune and cross validate. 
* Deployed the model using Flask & AWS
* In process of building a user facing API using streamlit to take the entire csv file and return a csv file with a prediction probability column.
