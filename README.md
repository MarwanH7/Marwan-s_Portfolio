# [Project 1: Flight Delays Prediction Estimator](https://github.com/MarwanH7/Flight-Prediction) 
* Created a Machine learning model that estimates flight delays 
* Wrote SQL queries in VSCode to export a sample of the data stored in a Postgress database
* Engineered features like weahter conditions (using weather API),route traffic, and aggregate datetime dates. 
* Optimized our linear regression model performance by using ensemble stacking technique to get best model.
